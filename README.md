## Welcome to STATS 315 / DATA SCI 315

This is an introductory deep learning course using the Python programming language and the TensorFlow deep learning library.

- **Textbook**: We will not follow any one textbook too closely. Here are a few references we will use:
  - _Dive into Deep Learning_ by Zhang, Lipton, Li and Smola. An advanced text from research scientists at Amazon. It weaves together math, figures, and code in an interactive online resource available [here](https://d2l.ai/). Code examples are provided in three frameworks: MXNet, PyTorch and TensorFlow. 
  - _Deep Learning with Python (2nd edition)_ by Chollet. A solid hands-on guide oriented towards programmers from the creator of the Keras deep learning library. Ebook and print versions are available from [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition)  
  - _Deep Learning_ by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. Written by three top deep learning researchers, this comprehensive book is required reading if you want to pursue your study of deep learning at a more advanced level. Print version is available from [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/deep-learning) and an online version is [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
  - _Understanding Deep Learning_ by Simon J.D. Prince. It promises to be a more up-to-date version of _Deep Learning_ by Goodfellow et al. and its spiritual successor. I might refer to it from time to time. Print version is available from [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048644/understanding-deep-learning/) and an online version is [here](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/).
  
- **Undergraduate Courses on Deep Learning**: Many universities now offer an introductory deep learning course, e.g., [Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182), [CMU](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/), [MIT](http://introtodeeplearning.com/), [Stanford](https://cs230.stanford.edu/)
- **Canvas**: You should access the [Canvas class page](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/578445) for this course frequently. It will let you access important announcements and track course deliverables. (requires UM login)
- **Slack**: The course slack workspace is at [um-wn24-stats315.slack.com](https://um-wn24-stats315.slack.com) (requires UM login)
- **Days and Times**: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1-2:30
- **Location**: [170 WEISER](https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/building/weiser-hall) (links for virtual lectures, if any, will be saved in the syllabus page on canvas)

## Academic Integrity

The University of Michigan community functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. The college promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity, and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty and misconduct. All cases of academic misconduct will be referred to the LSA Office of the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education. Being found responsible for academic misconduct will usually result in a grade sanction, in addition to any sanction from the college. For more information, including examples of behaviors that are considered academic misconduct and potential sanctions, please see [https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/academic-integrity.html](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/academic-integrity.html)

## Accommodation for Students with Disabilities

If you think you need accommodation for a disability, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Some aspects of this course, the assignments, the in-class activities, and the way the course is usually taught may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As soon as you make me aware of your needs, we can work with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) to help us determine appropriate academic accommodations. SSD (734-763-3000; [http://ssd.umich.edu/](http://ssd.umich.edu/)) typically recommends accommodations through a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will be treated as such.

## Mental Health and Well-Being

Students may experience stressors that can impact both their academic experience and their personal well-being. These may include academic pressures and challenges associated with relationships, mental health, alcohol or other drugs, identities, finances, etc. If you are experiencing concerns, seeking help is a courageous thing to do for yourself and those who care about you. If the source of your stressors is academic, please contact me so that we can find solutions together. For personal concerns, U-M offers a variety of resources, many which are listed on the [Resources for Student Well-being](https://wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu/resources-list) webpage. You can also search for additional well-being resources [here](https://wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu/well-being-resources).
